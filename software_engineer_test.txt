Basic Rules
===========
1. Review the questions in this file. Reply back via email with an estimated
   delivery date.
2. Answer each of the questions below.
3. Add your answer to each question to this file, in-line.
4. Send the final file back for review.
5. Bonus points if you add this initial file to your public git repo and share
   that repo with us so we can see how your answers progressed.
6. You may use external sources to help answer the questions (i.e. Google, etc),
   but you should always cite your sources in your comments. Learning from
   others is good. Plagiarism is bad.


Developer Test
==============

1.  What editor will you use to edit this file, and why?
2.  Some of the questions will ask for a solution in the language of
    your choice.  What language(s) will you choose, and why?
3.  Explain the difference between testing and debugging.
4.  Consider a user querying a search engine.  Describe, in as much
    detail as you like, what happens between the user clicking the
    "submit" button and the display of the results.

The two tables below describe relationships between employees,
managers, and departments (the columns employee.mgr_id and
department.head both refer to employee.id).  Use these definitions to
answer questions 5-10.  If you need to use any nonstandard functions or
syntax, be sure to name the DBMS that implements them.
